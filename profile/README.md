# About Sevalla

Sevalla is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure for building and deploying web applications. Our mission is to make you forget about the underlying infrastructure.

## Our products

We offer three main products to help you build and deploy your web applications:

### Application hosting

> Harness the power and stability of  Google Kubernetes Engine leaving all its `yaml`s behind,
and enjoy the added speed and protection of our  Cloudflare integration.

- Deploy your applications from any source, whether public or private Git repositories or Docker images.
- We support multiple runtimes and frameworks through our Buildpack / Nixpack-powered build environment and Dockerfile and Docker image support.
- Enhance your app's performance by choosing from GCP's 25 data centers worldwide.

### Database hosting

> No-fluff, reliable, scalable, and secure managed database hosting for developers
who want to focus on their project, not their infrastructure.

We provide a variety of database types to suit your needs:

- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- MySQL
- Redis
- Valkey

Provision the database of your choice in any of GCP's 25 data centers around the world, closest to your users.
Experience reduced latency and improved speed.

### Static site hosting

> Lightning-fast websites deployed directly to  Cloudflare's edge network.
Host your personal blog, portfolio, or business website for **free**.

- Deploy your sites either from GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
